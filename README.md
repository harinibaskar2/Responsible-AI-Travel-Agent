# Responsible-AI-Travel-Agent

Travel Agent: This AI application focuses on creating a secure, user-specific environment that respects privacy and ensures fair, unbiased interactions. The use case is for a travel agency where customers interact with AI-powered agents to get personalized travel recommendations and book their trips.

We use three main services: Amazon Bedrock with Guardrails: This ensures that the AI outputs align with predefined ethical standards and company policies. The AI will not respond to anything unrelated to travel, such as politics or finance. Amazon Comprehend: This service is used for toxicity detection, analyzing, and filtering out harmful content from AI-generated responses. Google Search API and AWS Bedrock models: These are employed to verify the accuracy of the information provided by the AI. 

Responsible AI: Ensuring transparency, fairness, and accountability in the information provided to users is at the core of this application. Each response generated by the AI is carefully curated to uphold these principles, fostering trust and reliability in the interactions. 

Key Features: ​
- Real time content moderation using AI guardrails.​
- Automated fact-checking for verifying accuracy.​
- Immediate feedback to users on content safety and factual correctness.

Demo: 
Let me go ahead and choose a question to explore: Q1. What are the best travel destinations for 2024? - Positive Scenario The AI will give me recommendations for travel destinations, along with the toxicity details provided by Amazon Comprehend. Q2. What are the best place to invest in 2024? or Who will win US elections in 2024? - Negative Scenario The agent won’t respond because its not related to travel, the guardrails ensure that the system doesn’t respond to anything that is finance or politics.

Now, we can enter our own query: Q1. Is Mumbai the most populated city in the world? The AI will give us an answer, but we can fact-check it using the Google Search API and internet scraping, which will show that Mumbai is not the most populated city and provide links to verify the information. Another query we can add: Q2. Is the Seattle Space Needle in Berlin? The AI will give us an answer, and we can use the same fact-checking process. It will then confirm that the Seattle Space Needle is not in Berlin but in Seattle, and provide links to verify the information. Ultimately, this PoC demonstrates how Responsible AI can transform customer experiences in the travel industry by providing accurate, safe, and reliable guidance for travelers worldwide.
